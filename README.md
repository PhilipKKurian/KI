# KI

## How to run the prototype
- Save vehicle_detection.py and vehicle_classifier.h5 in a local folder.
- Ensure Python and the following packages are installed on your device: tensorflow, numpy, cv2, pathlib
- Execute the Python file. (If the required packages are installed in a virtual environment, make sure you execute the file in the same environment.)

## Task
The aim of this task is to encourage you to critically analyze the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in a business environment. You will assess the feasibility, possible benefits, and potential challenges of implementing AI within a company. You will especially focus on the data acquisition necessary for effective AI implementation and evaluate if this can be achieved via a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). 
 

Task Description 

Identify the AI Opportunity: Identify an industry and a specific company within that industry where you believe AI could significantly impact operations, efficiency, customer satisfaction, or overall profitability. You can choose either an existing company or conceive a hypothetical one (Do not take the use case of tweet sentiment analysis we did in class). Determine a specific problem or opportunity where AI could be beneficial. Clearly state the problem or opportunity. 

Design the AI Solution: Describe the AI system that you propose to implement. Outline the AI technologies involved (e.g., machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, time series forecasting, recommendations, etc.), and how they would be integrated into the companyâ€™s existing operations. 

Risk Assessment: Identify potential risks associated with your AI solution, focusing primarily on the implications of incorrect predictions. 

What could be the impact of false positives and false negatives in your chosen business context? 

How could these risks be mitigated? 

Data Acquisition: Discuss how the company would obtain the necessary data to train and operate the AI. Identify potential sources of data. 

MVP Approach: Propose a strategy for introducing the AI solution through an MVP - a product with just enough features to satisfy early customers and provide feedback for future development. Discuss how this MVP would help to gather initial data, train the AI, and refine the system. 

Format 

The length of the report should be between 1000-4000 words. Also prepare a presentation of 5-10 slides. You might solve this task in groups of up to 2 (or 3) people. Your report and presentation will be assessed on the depth and clarity of your analysis, the feasibility and comprehensibility of your AI solution, data acquisition strategy and the MVP approach. It is important to showcase your understanding of the connection between AI and data.
